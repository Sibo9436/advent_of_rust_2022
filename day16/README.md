# Ideas 
To me there's a greedy (possibly dynamic) solution 
where we calculate at each step the value of opening a valve
(that has to do with the distance from us and the throughtput of 
all other valves within the same distance)
- should I calculate the distances between valves in advance?
- should I think of this from another perspective?
- to me this is a greedy problem with an interesting cost function
- tomorrow morning I'm gonna have a go at it
