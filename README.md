# Advent of Rust 2022 
I decided to use this year's AoC to improve my Rust skillset and brush off on some data structure and algorithms concepts
I'll try to keep the code as legible as I can whihle trying to appease the borrow checking gods.

If somehow you've found this repository and are asking yourself "Why is this not updated? Is he late?" the answer is probably yes, I'm not a competitive coder
so I don't expect myself to be able to complete all days before the next one

I'll still try to finish all days in a timely manner.

I'll be explaining how I approached the problem in the day's README

If you think you've found a better solution, implementation or whatever you are very welcome to fork the repo, implement it and submit a pull request, 
bonus points if you explain your thought process, the algorithm's complexity or whatever you think might help :smile:
They won't get merged because I want the open pull request tab to be kind of an "better/alternative solutions" page, and so I don't have to keep overwriting people's solutions

The issues page will be left for your suggestions on how to improve my rust skills, I'm very eager to learn more about a language that is very new to me.
So if you don't want to reimplement the entire problem to submit a pr, you can just file an issue and explain what I did wrong.

The final goal for this is to become some kind of community sourced rust learning resource, obviously focusing on the tools provided by the language itself
as I don't think I'll need something like tauri to solve coding problems.
